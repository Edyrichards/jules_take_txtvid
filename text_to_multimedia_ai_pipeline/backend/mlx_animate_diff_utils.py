# backend/mlx_animate_diff_utils.py
# Placeholder for MLX AnimateDiff Model Components
#
# IMPORTANT: This is a highly simplified placeholder.
# A real implementation would involve porting or using existing MLX versions of:
# - The AnimateDiff Motion Module.
# - Potentially an adapted UNet and VAE if AnimateDiff uses specific versions or
#   if it's integrated with a specific Stable Diffusion checkpoint's components.
# - The Stable Diffusion components (Tokenizer, Text Encoder, VAE, UNet) might be
#   reused if AnimateDiff is built on top of an existing SD pipeline, which is common.
#   In that case, this file might only define the MotionModule and how it interacts
#   with the existing SD UNet.
#
# For a functional version, refer to official or community MLX examples for AnimateDiff.

        print(f"PlaceholderMotionModule called with latents shape {latents.shape}")
        # This is a very crude pass-through, assuming latents are already (B, C, F, H_lat, W_lat)
        # or requires reshaping. For now, just return the input latents.
        # If input is (B, F, C, H, W), it would need to be permuted for Conv3D (B, C, F, H, W)

    # mx.eval(motion_module.parameters())

    # If AnimateDiff relies on fine-tuned UNet/VAE or specific versions,
    # they would be loaded here too. Otherwise, we might use the ones from Stable Diffusion.
    # For this placeholder, we assume we can reuse the SD UNet/VAE if needed,
    # or that the AnimateDiff process uses its own compatible versions.

    # The UNet used with AnimateDiff is often the one from the base SD model,
    # with the motion module integrated into its forward pass.
    # So, you might not load a separate UNet here but rather modify or wrap the SD UNet.
